        <p class="little">Hello and welcome to my site! I have created this webpage to basically serve as a scrapbook for me - as a small treasure trove of my likes, dislikes, interests, dreams and everything that make me uniquely me.<p>
            <h2 class="header2">These are some things I usually spend my time on:</h2>

                        <p class="little2">Writing is one of my biggest hobbies ever (the other, of course, is reading) and since March 2022, I have been working as a contributor at <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/shout">SHOUT.</a> My work for the weekly youth magazine - which happens to be published by the largest circulating English newspaper in Bangladesh, The Daily Star - encompasses everything relevant to the Bangladeshi youth: politics, mental health, pop culture and so much more. You can find all my articles <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/author/fabiha-afifa">here</a>.</p>

                        <p class="little2">MUN has been a huge part of my high school career. I have participated in over 10 conferences and won the Outstanding Delegate award at MIT MUN Conference 2022 and Harvard MUN China 2021. I have also served as an Assistant Director at Harvard MUN Dubai 2022 recently.</p>

                        <p class="little2">I work as a TA for my high school English teacher and a private math tutor. For the first job, my task is to check copies of 60+ sophomores on behalf of the teacher and for the latter, I prepare exam papers for around 20 seniors. I also teach A Level math (units P3 and P4) to a senior privately and previously taught English, math, biology and chemistry to a middle schooler.</p>
